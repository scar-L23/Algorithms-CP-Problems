#### Testing

Jest library is used to run unit tests. It provieds a very readable and expressive way to structure your test code.

Run all tests locally:
```shell
npm run test
```

Run specific file test cases:
```shell
npm run test <filename>
```

Run all test cases in watch mode while making changes on a file:
```shell
npm run test --watchAll
```
